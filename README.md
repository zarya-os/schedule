## Frequently asked questions

### Some applications don't switch their appearance

Like GNOME's built-in dark mode, the extension switches the standard freedesktop.org color scheme preference. Older applications might not follow this preference.

It is possible to force a GTK theme in the extension preferences, but please note that this can visually break applications. It is better to ask the developers of the applications to support the standard preference.

### Something doesn't work on Ubuntu

Unfortunately, Ubuntu ships heavily modified GNOME components to implement some of its features, like accent colors. Because it does so in a very hacky way instead of working with upstream and other desktop projects on a proper solution, it conflicts with anything that deals with the color scheme and themes, and results in a broken experience with the extension.

As the issue is in Ubuntu, and because I don't have the energy nor the will to work around the consequences of their decisions, unfortunately Ubuntu is not supported until it provides a standard GNOME environment.

### Switching happens too early/too late

There's a hidden setting to configure the offset (in hours) applied to the calculated sunrise and sunset times, you can change it with the `gsettings` command:

```
gsettings --schemadir ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/nightthemeswitcher@romainvigier.fr/schemas/ set org.gnome.shell.extensions.nightthemeswitcher.time offset $DESIRED_OFFSET
```

### I have disabled Location services but want to use sunrise and sunset times from my location

If you know your coordinates, you can enter them in a hidden setting, and the extension will use them to calculate the sunrise and sunset times. You can set it with the `gsettings` command:

```
gsettings --schemadir ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/nightthemeswitcher@romainvigier.fr/schemas/ set org.gnome.shell.extensions.nightthemeswitcher.time location '($LATITUDE,$LONGITUDE)'
```
